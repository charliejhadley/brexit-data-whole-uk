# Brexit Data for the Whole of the UK

There doesn't appear to be an official Government data file that contains the Brexit 2016 Referendum results for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. This [.csv file **does** contain this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charliejhadley/brexit-data-whole-uk/main/data/brexit-referendum-results.csv) - exclusively from the following Government sources:

- geoportal.statistics.gov.uk
- data.london.gov.uk
- opendatani.gov.uk

This repo also contains ESRI shapefiles for each consistuency. Both datasets were generated by the `data/obtain-data.R` script in this repo.

Explicitly, here are the data sources:

- Shapefiles for Northern Ireland are the [2016 Westerminster Parliamentary Constituencies](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/westminster-parliamentary-constituencies-december-2016-full-clipped-boundaries-in-the-uk).

- Shapefiles for England, Scotland and Wales are the [2016 Local Authority Districts](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/local-authority-districts-december-2016-full-clipped-boundaries-in-the-uk).

- Election results for England, Scotland and Wales were obtained from [data.london.gov.uk](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/eu-referendum-results?q=EU%20referend)

- Election results for Northern Ireland were obtained from [opendatani.gov.uk](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/eu-referendum-23-june-2016/resource/61cfee40-69f6-444e-bf03-3dd60bd6e1dc)

The `brexit-map.R` script was used to generate the Brexit map below, it uses the yellow and blue colours popularised by [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results) (and others).
